Smart Skin Tracker
Your Personal AI-Powered Dermatology Assistant

Smart Skin Tracker is a computer-vision–powered application that helps you monitor your skin health daily using your webcam or uploaded photos. Whether you're tracking acne, hyperpigmentation, whiteheads, redness, or overall complexion, this tool gives you data-driven insights and visual progress graphs — just like having your own dermatologist assistant.

This project combines Python, OpenCV, and an interactive dashboard to deliver smart skin analytics in real time.
